## Data Tools and Algorithms

- [Dipper:](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/dipper) Dipper is a Python package to generate RDF triples from common scientific resources.
- [Biolink API:](https://api.monarchinitiative.org/api/) API integration layer for linked biological objects.
- [Exomiser:](https://exomiser.monarchinitiative.org/exomiser/) The Exomiser is a Java program that functionally annotates variants from whole-exome sequencing data in VCF 4 format.

## Standards

- [Phenopacket:](http://phenopackets.org/) An open standard for sharing disease and phenotype information.

## Monarch web

- [Analyze Phenotypes:](https://monarchinitiative.org/analyze/phenotypes) The Phenotype Analysis Tool enables you search our database using the OwlSim Semantic Similarity analysis engine to find phenotypically similar diseases or genes in a variety of organisms, then visualize their overlap. Results will be displayed using [Phenogrid](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenogrid), a Javascript component that visualizes semantic similarity calculations provided through APIs from the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org).
- [Text mining:](https://monarchinitiative.org/annotate/text) Text Annotator provided by the [SciGraph](https://github.com/SciGraph/SciGraph) Annotation Service

## Evaluation tools

- [Reusable Data Licensing Rubric:](http://reusabledata.org/) The (Re)usable Data Project created a rubric to evaluate resources on how well we believe a resource's data may build upon, edited, modified, and redistributed.
